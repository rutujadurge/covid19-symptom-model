# COVID-19 Symptom Model

## Overview

This project simulates common COVID-19 symptoms by generating random data for 100 individuals. The data includes symptoms such as fever, cold, shivering, and weight loss. The program allows sorting of this data by the chosen symptom.

## Features

  - **Fever**: Temperature in Â°F (between 97.0 and 104.0)
  - **Cold**: True or False
  - **Shivering**: True or False
  - **Weight Loss**: Random weight loss (0 to 10 kg)
- Allows sorting the dataset based on a user-selected symptom.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** (for data manipulation)
